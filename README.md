# Tree

Tree Review
Congratulations, you have implemented a tree in Python.

For review, in our implementation:

Trees are a Python class called TreeNode.
A TreeNode has two properties, value and children.
Nodes hold any type of data inside value.
children is a list, which can be empty or hold other instances of TreeNode.
We add to children by using the list method .append.
We remove from children by filtering the list.
